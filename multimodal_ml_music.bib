The mood of a song is expressed by means of musical features but a relevant part also seems to be conveyed by the lyrics. We evaluate each factor independently and explore the possibility to combine both, using Natural Language Processing and Music Information Retrieval techniques. We show that standard distance-based methods and Latent Semantic Analysis are able to classify the lyrics significantly better than random , but the performance is still quite inferior to that of audio-based techniques. We then introduce a method based on differences between language models that gives performances closer to audio-based classifiers. Moreover, integrating this in a multimodal system (audio+text) allows an improvement in the overall performance. We demonstrate that lyrics and audio information are complementary, and can be combined to improve a classification system.},

This paper explores techniques for collecting and combining multiple sources of such information for the purpose of building a query-by-text music retrieval system. We consider two representations of the acoustic content (related to timbre and harmony) and two social sources (social tags and web documents). We then compare three algorithms that combine these information sources: calibrated score averaging (CSA), RankBoost, and kernel combination support vector machines (KC-SVM). We demonstrate empirically that each of these algorithms is superior to algorithms that use individual information sources. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

Moreover, MusiCLEF aims at maintaining a tight connection with real application scenarios, focusing on issues on music access and retrieval that are faced by professional users.

Music is often enjoyed and sought for its ability to induce or convey emotions, which may manifest in anything from a slight variation in mood, to changes in our physical condition and actions. Consequently, research on how we might associate musical pieces with emotions and, more generally, how music brings about an emotional response is attracting ever increasing attention. First, this paper provides a thorough review of studies on the relation of music and emotions from different disciplines. We then propose new insights to enhance automated music emotion recognition models using recent results from psychology, musicology, affective computing, semantic technologies and music information retrieval. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

Each branch takes one modality as the input and it is constrained with emotion tags. Then the constraints allow the cross-modal embeddings to be learned with significantly fewer music-video pairs. To retrieve music for an input video, the trained model ranks tracks in the music database by cross-modal distances to the query video. Quantitative evaluations show high accuracy of audio/video emotion tagging when evaluated on each branch independently and high performance for cross-modal music retrieval. We also present cross-modal music retrieval experiments on Spotify music using user-generated videos from Instagram and Youtube as queries, and subjective evaluations show that the proposed model can retrieve relevant music.

  abstract = {This paper presents Query-by-Blending, a novel music exploration system that enables users to find unfamiliar music content by flexibly combining three musical aspects: lyric word, song audio, and artist. Although there are various systems for music retrieval based on the similarity between songs or artists and for music browsing based on visualized songs, it is still difficult to explore unfamiliar content by flexibly combining multiple musical aspects. Query-by-Blending overcomes this difficulty by representing each of the aspects as a latent vector representation (called a "flavor" in this paper) that is a distinctive quality felt to be characteristic of a given word/song/artist. By giving a lyric word as a query, for example, a user can find songs and artists whose flavors are similar to the flavor of the query word. Moreover, by giving a query combining (blending) lyric-word and song-audio flavors, the user can interactively explore unfamiliar content containing the blended flavor. This multi-aspect blending was achieved by constructing a novel vector space model into which all of the lyric words, song audio tracks, and artist IDs of a collection can be embedded. In our experiments, we embedded 14,505 lyric words, 433,936 songs, and 44,696 artists into the same shared vector space and found that the system can appropriately calculate similarities between different aspects and blend flavors to find related lyric words, songs, and artists.},

@unpublished{Favory2020a,
  abstract = {Self-supervised audio representation learning offers an attractive alternative for obtaining generic audio embeddings, capable to be employed into various downstream tasks. Published approaches that consider both audio and words/tags associated with audio do not employ text processing models that are capable to generalize to tags unknown during training. In this work we propose a method for learning audio representations using an audio autoencoder (AAE), a general word embed-dings model (WEM), and a multi-head self-attention (MHA) mechanism. MHA attends on the output of the WEM, providing a contextualized representation of the tags associated with the audio, and we align the output of MHA with the output of the encoder of AAE using a contrastive loss. We jointly optimize AAE and MHA and we evaluate the audio representations (i.e. the output of the encoder of AAE) by utilizing them in three different downstream tasks, namely sound, music genre, and music instrument classification. Our results show that employing multi-head self-attention with multiple heads in the tag-based network can induce better learned audio representations.},
